/**
 * @file
 * @brief MSD FAT Filesystem Driver
 *
 * This library can be used to communicate with Mass Storage Devices (MSD) which
 * have partitions formated as FAT32. It is recommended to make the cluster
 * allocation size at least 4KiB, however 64KiB will provide the best
 * performance.
 *
 * Currently only drives with a logical block size of 512 bytes are supported,
 * which is the most common block size available. Larger drives and SSDs may
 * not work.
 *
 * The drive must use MBR partitioning, GPT and others are not yet supported.
